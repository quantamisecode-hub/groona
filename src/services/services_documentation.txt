Services Folder Documentation (src/services)

Overview
--------
The `src/services` folder contains modules that handle complex business logic and API orchestration, particularly for feature‑specific workflows like AI‑assisted project and task creation.

Files
-----
### 1. aiProjectService.js
Orchestrates the creation of projects and tasks based on AI Assistant conversation data.
- **`createProjectFromAI(projectData, tenantId, userId, userEmail)`**:
  - Purpose: POSTs project metadata to `${API_URL}/groona-assistant/create-project`.
  - Logic: Handles auth headers and payload formatting.
- **`parseProjectCreationResponse(aiResponse)`**:
  - Purpose: Extracts structured JSON data from AI chat responses using both `JSON.parse` and regex fallback.
  - Supported Actions: `create_project`, `create_task`.
- **`isProjectCreationResponse(aiResponse)`**:
  - Purpose: Boolean helper to check if a response specifically triggers a project creation action.

### 2. aiTaskService.js
Focuses on the creation of individual tasks via the AI Assistant.
- **`createTaskFromAI(taskData, tenantId, userId, userEmail)`**:
  - Purpose: POSTs task details to `${API_URL}/groona-assistant/create-task`.
  - Validation: Specifically handles `estimated_hours` by ensuring it is a valid non‑negative number before sending.
  - Payloads: Includes title, project/sprint names, assignee details, and deadlines.

Developer Notes
---------------
- Services leverage the `groonabackend` API wrapper (`@/api/groonabackend`) but often use direct `fetch` for specific assistant endpoints.
- Error handling is centralised within each service to log errors and re‑throw them for UI components to handle.
- Parsing logic in `aiProjectService` is designed to be resilient to AI responses that may contain extra conversational text around JSON blocks.
